<h3>What is SNAPP?</h3>
SNAPP allows users to visualize interactions resulting from discussion
forum posts and replies. The network visualisations of forum
interactions provide an opportunity for teachers to rapidly identify
patterns of user behaviour - at any stage of course
progression.&nbsp; SNAPP has been developed to extract discussion
forum user interactions from various commercial and open source
learning management systems. SNAPP currently supports Blackboard, WebCT
and Moodle and runs within Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari on
both PC and Mac computers.<br>

<h3>Visualisation</h3>
The "Visualisation" tab renders a social network diagram from the
extracted forum interactions.&nbsp;Social network visualisations
provide a snapshot of who is communicating with whom and to what level.
A network diagram of your students' discussions online can:<br>
<ul>
  <li>identify disconnected (at risk) students</li>
  <li>identify key information brokers within your class</li>
  <li>identify potentially high and low performing students so
you can plan interventions before you even mark their work</li>
  <li>indicate the extent to which a learning community is
developing in your class</li>
  <li>provide you with a "before and after" snapshot of what
kinds of interactions happened before and after you intervened/ changed
your learning activity design (useful to see what effect your changes
have had on student interactions and for demonstrating reflective
teaching practice e.g. through a teaching portfolio)</li>
  <li>allow your students to benchmark their performance without
the need for marking</li>
</ul>
Each person/participant is represented by a node, and interactions
between participants are replresented by a line (connection which
aggregates the number of posts made between two nodes).<strong><br>
<br>
Controls:</strong><br>
<br>
You can <strong>zoom in</strong> and <strong>zoom
out</strong> of the diagram using zoom in/ zoom out and the mouse
wheel (if "mouse wheel zoom" checkbox is selected).<br>
<br>
Two <strong>selection modes</strong> are available:
transforming and picking. <strong>Transforming</strong>
allows you to move the diagram in the visible window. <strong>Picking</strong>
allows you to select individual nodes (representing individual people)
and move them - for example, to see them better and/or to make the
diagram easier to view.<br>
<br>
Various <strong>layout</strong> algorithms are available.
Select a layout from the dropdown box and the social graph will be
rendered using the selected algorithm.<br>
<strong>Hovering</strong> over a node/person displays the number of posts as well as indegree and outdegree values.
<br/>
<strong>Hovering</strong> over a connection displays the no of replies made between two participants.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Filter:</strong><br>
<br>
SNAPP allows the social graph to be filtered based upon the number of
connections between people or participants. The <strong>Enable
Filtering</strong> checkbox must be checked to see graph updates
as a result of changing filtering criteria. Social interactions can be
filtered based on whether the connections of a person are greater than
or less than a numeric value. <br>
<br>
<strong>People:</strong><br>
<br>
You will usually see individual's names by default, but if you want to
hide the names (as per the example shown), you can deselect the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><strong>Show
Names"</strong> checkbox.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><strong>Scale
Nodes by Number of Posts"</strong> option allows you to turn off
and on whether you view the numbers of interactions an individual in
the network diagram has via the size of their node (round ball
representing the individual).&nbsp; When this selection is on (as
it is by default), a larger node represents an individual with more
interactions in the network diagram.&nbsp; This is an easy way to
identify the amount of activity from individuals in the network.<br>
<br>
<strong>Connections:</strong><br>
<br>
The "<strong>Show Posts between Participants</strong>"
option, shows or hides the numbers of posts along the connecting lines
in the diagram.<br>
<br>
The <strong>"Scale Connections by Number of Posts"</strong>
option, thickens connecting lines according to the amount of posts made.
<h3>Statistics</h3>
The "Statistics" tab displays a "posting frequency" table. This table
lists the number of posts and replies to posts made by each individual.
Click on either the "Name" or "No Posts" table headers to re-order the
participants by either name or the number of posts they have made. A
search is provide to help locate participants.
<h3>Export</h3>
Extracted forum interactions are available for export in both the .vna
and the graphml formats. The .vna format is used by <a
 href="http://www.analytictech.com/downloadnd.htm">NetDraw</a>,
a popular social network analysis tool available for the PC. Within
NetDraw, additional social network metrics and visualisations are
available. <br>
<br>
<strong>Saving exported data to the .vna format:</strong><br>
<ol>
  <li>Hightlight and copy all of the text in the VNA file format
textarea (Ctrl+C).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Open Notepad and paste text into Notepad (Ctrl+V).</li>
  <li>Save the file with a .vna file extension. NetDraw can be
used to open the .vna file format.</li>
</ol>
